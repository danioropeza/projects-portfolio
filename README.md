## Volunteering
### Software Development Guide | START Americas Together

I created a link between the START organization and UCB so that the students of the "Software Development Workshop" subject can create an application from scratch for START.

I guided students by teaching them the best technical practices for creating a public-ready application from my experience. Constantly, I recommended improvements to the product technically and non-technically talking.

The web application allows the START team to create projects/events where volunteers can join and participate.
